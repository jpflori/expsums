Research about exponential sums and bent functions

Study the Walsh spectrum of a family of Boolean function.
Up to a slightly incomplete conjecture the full Walsh spectrum can be made explicit for a subfamily.
In particular a simple condition on the parameter of the full family could then be shown to be equivalent to bentness.
