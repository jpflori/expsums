abstract={Charpin and Gong recently characterized a large class of hyperbent functions defined on fields of order 2n, which include the well-known monomial functions with the Dillon exponent as a special case. We give a reformulation of the Charpin-Gong criterion in terms of the number of rational points on certain hyperelliptic curves. We present two applications of our result: The time needed to check the hyperbentness of a specific function is now polynomial in n , and hyperbent functions with subfield coefficients can be constructed.},

We extensively study the links between K(a) and other exponential sums, in particular with the cubic sums. We point out (as we did for odd m) that the values K(a) are related with cosets of weight 4 of primitive narrow sense extended BCH codes of length n = 2m and minimum distance 8.},

abstract={Charpin and Gong recently characterized a large class of hyperbent functions defined on fields of order 2n, which include the well-known monomial functions with the Dillon exponent as a special case. We give a reformulation of the Charpin-Gong criterion in terms of the number of rational points on certain hyperelliptic curves. We present two applications of our result: The time needed to check the hyperbentness of a specific function is now polynomial in n , and hyperbent functions with subfield coefficients can be constructed.},
